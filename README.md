# Why? ü§∑

We found ourselves copy-pasting a few useful "helper" functions
across our Elixir projects ... <br />
it wasn't
["DRY"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself),
so we created this library.

# What? üí≠

A library of useful functions that we need for building `Elixir` Apps.

# Who? üë§

This library is for our use on our various `Elixir` / `Phoenix` apps.
As with everything we do it's Open Source, Tested and Documented
so that _anyone_ can benefit from it.

# How? üíª

## Install ‚¨áÔ∏è

Install by adding `useful` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:useful, "~> 1.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Function Reference 

### `atomize_map_keys/1`

Converts a `Map` that has strings as keys (or mixed keys)
to have only atom keys. e.g:

```elixir
#¬†map that has different types of keys:
my_map = %{"name" => "Alex", id: 1}
Useful.atomize_map_keys(my_map)
%{name: Alex, id: 1}
```

Works recursively for deeply nested maps:

```elixir
person = %{"name" => "Alex", id: 1, details: %{"age" => 17, height: 185}}
Useful.atomize_map_keys(person)
%{name: Alex, id: 1, details: %{age: 17, height: 185}}
```

### `flatten_map/1`

Flatten a `Map` of any depth/nesting:

```elixir
iex> map = %{name: "alex", data: %{age: 17, height: 185}}
iex> Useful.flatten_map(map)
%{data__age: 17, data__height: 185, name: "alex"}
```

**Note**: `flatten_map/1` converts all Map keys to `Atom`
as it's easier to work with atoms as keys
e.g: `map.person__name` instead of `map["person__name"]`.
We use the `__` (_double underscore_)
as the delimiter for the keys of nested maps,
because if we attempt to use `.` (_period character_)
we get an error:

```elixir
iex(1)> :a.b
** (UndefinedFunctionError) function :a.b/0 is undefined (module :a is not available)
    :a.b()
```

### `stringify_tuple/1`

Stringify a tuple of any length; useful in debugging.

```elixir
iex> tuple = {:ok, :example}
iex> Useful.stringify_tuple(tuple)
"ok: example"
```

### `typeof/1`

Returns the type of a variable, e.g: "function" or "integer"
Inspired by 
[**`typeof`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)
from `JavaScript` land.

```elixir
iex> myvar = 42
iex> Useful.typeof(myvar)
"integer"
```

# Help Us Help You! üôè 

If you need a specific helper function or utility 
(e.g: something you found useful in a different programming language),
please 
[open an issue](https://github.com/dwyl/useful/issues)
so that we can all benefit from useful functions. 

Thanks!
