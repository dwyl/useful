# `useful`

A collection of useful functions for working in `Elixir`.


#Â Why?

We found ourselves copy-pasting a few useful "helper" functions
across our Elixir projects and it wasn't 
["DRY"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
So we put a stop to the copy-pasting and created this library.

# What?

A library of useful functions that we need for building apps in `Elixir`.


# Who?

This library is for our use on our various `Elixir` / `Phoenix` apps.
As with everything we do it's Open Source, Tested and Documented 
so that _anyone_ can benefit from it.
